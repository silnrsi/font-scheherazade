#### Known issues
- Shaping for the newly added characters may not yet occur in applications
- Medial and final high hamza characters may have collisions (these likely do not occur)
- Lam + high hamza alef ligature does not form as it likely does not occur
- In InDesign: some behaviors, such as the _lam-alef_ ligature, raised _kasra_ with _shadda_, and subtending marks, will not function correctly unless **Ligatures** is turned on in the **Characters** panel.
