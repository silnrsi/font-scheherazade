Our font announcements are also available through X (formerly Twitter) [@silfonts](https://x.com/silfonts).

## Current versions

The latest version of the font is always available from the [Scheherazade New download page](https://software.sil.org/scheherazade/download/) as a .zip archive for all major platforms.

This font package is also available in the [SIL software repository for Ubuntu](https://packages.sil.org/). Users can subscribe to this software repository and get current versions and updates automatically.

Scheherazade New is also available through the [TypeTuner Web](https://scripts.sil.org/ttw/fonts2go.cgi) service, which allows you to choose among the smart font features and download a font with those features preset. This enables them to work in many applications that do not make use of Graphite or OpenType Character Variants.

## Previous versions

Previous versions remain available from our [Previous Versions archive](https://software.sil.org/scheherazade/download/previous-versions).

## Change history

A detailed list of changes for each version of the fonts is on the [Version history page](history).
