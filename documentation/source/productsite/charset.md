The Scheherazade New font contains complete coverage of all the characters defined in Unicode for Arabic script (excluding the Arabic Presentation Forms blocks, which are not recommended for normal use).  

[Arabic (U+0600..U+06FF)](https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0600.pdf) was added to Unicode 1.0. [Arabic Supplement (U+0750..U+077F)](https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0750.pdf) was added to Unicode 4.1, [Arabic Extended-A (U+08A0..U+08FF)](https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U08A0.pdf) was added to Unicode 6.1, [Arabic Extended-B (U+0870..U+089F)](https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0870.pdf) was added to Unicode 14.0, and [Arabic Extended-C (U+10EC0..U+10EFF)](https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U10EC0.pdf) was added to Unicode 15.0. There are still some Arabic script characters being added to Unicode, so it is possible that not all languages using the Arabic script are fully represented in Unicode.
