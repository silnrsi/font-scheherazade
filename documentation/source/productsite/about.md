## About this project

Scheherazade New, named after the heroine of the classic Arabian Nights tale, is designed in a similar style to traditional typefaces such as Monotype Naskh, extended to cover the Unicode Arabic repertoire through Unicode 16.0.

For more information on the visual characteristics of the font see [Design](design).


## Future plans

This font is actively maintained and improved, and recent changes to its development process will enable more frequent releases.

The highest priorities for future additions and enhancements are mainly driven by:

- New additions to [The Unicode Standard](https://unicode.org/)
- Requests from language communities using the fonts
- Needs of the linguistic and academic community

Please send us your requests using the [form on the font website](https://software.sil.org/scheherazade/about/contact/). If you are interested in helping us make the font better see the [Developer](developer) page.
