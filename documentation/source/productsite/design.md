Scheherazade New provides a “simplified” rendering of Arabic script, using basic connecting glyphs but not including a wide variety of additional ligatures or contextual alternates (only the required lam-alef ligatures). This simplified style is often preferred for clarity, especially in non-Arabic languages, but may not be considered appropriate in situations where a more elaborate style of calligraphy is preferred.

Four fonts from this typeface family are included in the *Scheherazade New* release:

- Scheherazade New Regular
- Scheherazade New Medium
- Scheherazade New SemiBold
- Scheherazade New Bold
