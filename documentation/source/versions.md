This font package is also available in the [SIL software repository for Ubuntu](http://packages.sil.org/). Users can subscribe to this software repository and get current versions and updates automatically.

Scheherazade New is also available through the [TypeTuner Web](http://scripts.sil.org/ttw/fonts2go.cgi) service, which allows you to choose among the smart font features and download a font with those features preset. This enables them to work in many applications that do not make use of Graphite or OpenType Character Variants.
