    <p>The SIL Arabic script fonts are encoded according to Unicode, so
    your application must support Unicode text in order to access
    letters other than the standard ANSI characters. Most applications
    now provide basic Unicode support. You will, however, need some way
    of entering Unicode text into your document.</p>
    <p>Arabic script is a complex and difficult script, and this
    complexity is compounded by the fact that Arabic script is used for
    <a href="https://scriptsource.org/scr/Arab">many different
    languages</a> and cultures with variations in acceptable
    calligraphic style. From a computer perspective at least, the
    technologies used to implement Arabic script are not yet fully
    mature. The result is that while a given font might work for one set
    of languages on a given software platform, the same font might not
    work for other languages or on other platforms. This means that it
    is very difficult to give an accurate answer to the question of
    software requirements.</p>
    <h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
    <p>This font is supported by all major operating systems (macOS,
    Windows, Linux-based, iOS, and Android), however the extent of that
    support depends on the individual OS and application.</p>
    <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
    <p>Install the font by decompressing the .zip archive and installing
    the font using the standard font installation process for .ttf
    (TrueType/OpenType) fonts for your platform. For additional tips see
    the help page on <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/fonts/installation">Font
    installation</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="keyboarding-and-character-set-support">Keyboarding and
    character set support</h2>
    <p>This font package does not include keyboards or other software
    for entering text. To type the symbols in this font, use the
    keyboarding systems provided in your OS or use a separate utility.
    <a href="https://keyman.com/">Keyman</a> is a cross-platform
    keyboarding system.</p>
    <p>Various other means may be available for different
    operating-system platforms to create additional input methods.</p>
    <p>See <a href="charset.html">Character set support</a> for details
    of the Unicode characters supported by this font.</p>
    <h2 id="rendering-and-application-support">Rendering and application
    support</h2>
    <p>These fonts are designed to work with the OpenType advanced font
    technology. To take advantage of the advanced typographic
    capabilities of these fonts, you must be using applications that
    provide an adequate level of support for OpenType.</p>

    <h2 id="web-fonts">Web fonts</h2>
    <p>Web font versions of this font (in WOFF and WOFF2 formats) are
    available in the <code>web</code> folder. These can be copied to a
    web server and used as fonts on web pages. A very basic HTML/CSS
    demo page is also included. For more information on the options and
    techniques available for using these fonts on web pages see <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/fonts/webfonts">Using SIL Fonts on
    Web Pages</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="text-conversion">Text conversion</h2>
    <p>One common type of data conversion is from Roman script to Arabic
    script. Cross-script conversion is often very language specific.
    TECkit is one program that can be used for character encoding
    conversion. TECkit allows users to write their own custom conversion
    mappings. The TECkit package is available for download from SIL’s <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/teckit/">TECkit</a> Web site. The <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/silconverters/">SIL Converters</a>
    software will be an important tool in data conversion.</p>
