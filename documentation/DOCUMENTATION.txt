DOCUMENTATION
Scheherazade New
========================

The documentation for this project is listed in index.html.

There are also PDF versions of these files in the `pdf` folder.

Some of these html files assume the Scheherazade New font is available in the
`../web/` folder. This will be the case if you have downloaded and unpacked 
the released font product zip. However, if you have cloned the source repo 
from GitHub this will not be the case, and you should view the PDFs instead.

Developer notes:

These html and pdf files are produced from markdown sources (in `source`) using pandoc,
weasyprint, and custom python scripts. See the `makedocs` shell script
in the main project folder.

For documents such as features.md that turn on language-specific rendering 
for Kyrgyz (ky) and Wolof (wo), weasyprint requires 3-letter codes rather than 
the standard 2-letter codes used in html. Therefore, when generating pdf for 
features.md we temporarily replace the lang attributes with values that will 
generate correct rendering (see `makedocs`).
