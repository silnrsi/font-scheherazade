    <text lang="en">
      Scheherazade New, named after the heroine of the classic Arabian Nights tale,
      is designed in a similar style to traditional typefaces such as Monotype Naskh,
      extended to cover the full Unicode Arabic repertoire.
      
      This font provides a simplified rendering of Arabic script, using basic
      connecting glyphs but not including a wide variety of additional ligatures
      or contextual alternates (only the required lam-alef ligatures). This
      simplified style is often preferred for clarity, especially in non-Arabic
      languages, but may be considered unattractive in more traditional and
      literate communities.

      SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
      -----------------------------------------------------------
      
      PREAMBLE
      The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with others.
      
      The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
